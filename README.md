## xNIDS: Explaining Deep Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems for Active Intrusion Responses

This repo includes the source code for the "Explaining Deep Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems for Active Intrusion Responses" project. The code is hardware-independent and can be optimized for execution on Google Colab.

 
## Implementation Notes

Testing and running the code is straightforward, giving users the flexibility to utilize either Google Colab or a local machine for their testing purposes.

1. **Google Colab**:
   > git clone https://github.com/CactiLab/code-xNIDS.git
   - Rename the folder
   > mv code-xNIDS   xNIDS
   - Upload the folder to **Colab Notebooks** folder under google drive
   - Run the Demo **explanation.ipynb** notebook
   - Although a GPU is not required, it can significantly accelerate the execution
     
2. **Local Machine**:
   
   > pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   > python explanation.py
   
 3. **Retrain the DL-NIDS**
    - Please carefully update the testcases accordingly in the **explantion.py** if the users want to retrain the models. 
    - **kitsune.ipynb** contains the reimplementation of kitnet. Please download the dataset and put them under the **Data** folder.
    - **kdd.ipynb** includes one *Autoencoder* and one **stateless** *RNN* based DL-NIDS
    - **kdd_histroy.ipynb** contains one **stateful** LSTM based DL-NIDS.
